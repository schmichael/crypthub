# crypthub

omg dont use this its just a toy im playing around if you need to encrypt things suffer through pgp/gpg i guess or listen to someone who knows what they're talking about:

![use signal](signals.png)

```
go get github.com/schmichael/crypthub

echo "foo" | crypthub encrypt schmichael

# crypthub decrypt doesn't work yet because private keys are tricky to read
```
